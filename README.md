# map.py
Launches Google Maps directions action

**Based on Al Sweigert's mapit.py (Automate the Boring Stuff)**

Uses Google Maps API directions action to show walking time and route to destination. Destination can be specified as a command line argument or taken from the clipboard. A batch file allows map.py to be run from the Windows Run window.
